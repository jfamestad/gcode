This program is intended to simplify the writing of gcode for CNC machine control. It is capable of generating tool
paths for basic boring operations.

Gcode is dumped to stdout. Nothing else is written to stdout making it suitable for calling directly from LinuxCNC. 

I am NOT responsible for any damage to you, your machine, your part, or anything else! Please use responsibly and at
your own risk. Always review the output gcode for suitability and use a simulation tool to double check your work. If
you are unsure about anything the only way to be absolutely safe is not to execute the generated code.

All that said, I have executed some basic boring operations using toolpaths generated with this script successfully on a
Taig Milling Machine using LinuxCNC.

Currently, the script takes no inputs. Some basic config is hardcoded in the first few lines and the bore to be cut is
defined near the end. This is a starting point and I do plan on enhancing the UI once I get a few more shapes handled
and potentially optimize some aspects of the toolpath that I think can be improved.

I am distributing this under the 3-clause BSD license so you are free to use the software as you please with or without
modification. Your contributions are welcome and encouraged so if you make some useful changes, please contribute them
back! If you use it to do something cool, I would love to hear about it. 

Happy Machining!
